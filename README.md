# To get started: 



```
git clone https://github.com/laurashub/BMIBootcamp2020.git
conda env create -f ml-tutorial.yml
conda activate ml-tutorial
python -m ipykernel install --user --name="Python (ml-tutorial)"
```

When you run the notebooks, make sure your kernel is set to "Python (ml-tutorial)" and all the import statements should (hopefully) work. Worst comes to worst you can wrestle with pip and conda for a bit.

# Notebooks:
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Neural networks 

Each notebook has blanks to be filled in and some questions. No worries about turning anything in - it's more for you to play around with and remind you of some questions you could be asking yourself when approaching a machine learning problem. I'll upload the "keys" later.
